<h1>Vulkan Tutorial</h1>

<h3>2-2 - Compute Shader</h3>

<p>In this article, we will try to measure the performance of a Vulkan device
in TFLOPS (Tera FLoating-point Operations Per Second).
We will create simple compute shader that will contain stream of 10'000 instructions,
we will execute the shader many times on particular device,
we will measure the execution time and print the measured performance.</p>

<p>In this article, we will learn to use shaders and pipelines.
A shader contains stream of instructions.
Pipelines control how graphics or compute work is executed on the device.
A pipeline includes one or more shaders and state controlling any non-programmable stages of the pipeline.</p>


<h3>Shader code</h3>

<p>We will use simple equation in our shader:</p>
<pre>
x = x * y + z;
</pre>

<p>This equation uses two math operations: multiplication and addition.
Interestingly, many computing devices provide single instruction,
usually called FMA (Fused Multiply Addition) that encodes multiply and addition operations.</p>

<p>Now, we need to repeat the equation 10'000 times.
We will use macros for it:</p>

<pre>
#define FMA10 \
	x = x*y+z; \
	x = x*y+z; \
	x = x*y+z; \
	x = x*y+z; \
	x = x*y+z; \
	x = x*y+z; \
	x = x*y+z; \
	x = x*y+z; \
	x = x*y+z; \
	x = x*y+z

#define FMA100 \
	FMA10; \
	FMA10; \
	FMA10; \
	FMA10; \
	FMA10; \
	FMA10; \
	FMA10; \
	FMA10; \
	FMA10; \
	FMA10
</pre>

<p>Now, FMA10 macro provides 10 FMA instructions and FMA100 provides 100 FMA instructions.
In the similar way, we create FMA1000 and FMA10000 macros.
Finally, we provide the main() function:</p>

<pre>
void main()
{
	// initial values of x, y and z
	float x = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;
	float y = gl_GlobalInvocationID.y;
	float z = gl_GlobalInvocationID.z;

	FMA10000;

	// condition that will never be true in reality
	// (this avoids optimizer to consider the results of previous computations as unused
	// and to optimize the final shader code by their removal)
	if(x == 0.1) {
		// write to artificially generated address
		// (the write will never happen in reality)
		OutputDataRef data = OutputDataRef(uint64_t(0));
		data.outputFloat = y;
	}
}
</pre>

<p>First, we assign initial values to x, y and z values.
Compute shaders usually run many invocations in parallel.
gl_GlobalInvocationID is uvec3 that contains index of shader invocation
in x, y and z dimension. We convert it to float and use for our x, y and z variables.</p>

<p>After the computation of 10'000 FMA instructions, there is one danger.
If we do not use the results of our computation, some optimizer might jump in
and remove all our computation as needless. This would spoil our measurements
as we really want these 10'000 FMA instructions even if we do not use the results.
So, we compare final x value with 0.1 and write y to address 0.
Obviously, x will never be 0.1 so we will never write anything to address 0.
But the outcome is that our 10'000 FMA instructions is not optimized out.</p>

<p>The last missing piece is the shader header:</p>

<pre>
#version 460
#extension GL_EXT_buffer_reference : require
#extension GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64 : require

layout(local_size_x=32, local_size_y=4, local_size_z=1) in;


layout(buffer_reference) restrict writeonly buffer OutputDataRef {
	float outputFloat;
};
</pre>

<p>It is written in GLSL language version 4.6 and it uses
GL_EXT_buffer_reference and GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64 extensions.
Both are necessary for our fictive write to address zero.</p>

<p>Layout with local_size_x, y and z defines the size of local workgroup.
Local workgroup is composed of 32x4x1 shader invocations.
So, there is 128 invocations in total in local workgroup.
More on this later, when we will deal with vkCmdDispatch() command.</p>

<p>Layout(buffer_reference) specifies OutputDataRef type to be buffer reference.
We need the type to arrange our fictive write to address zero.</p>


<h3>GLSL to SPIR-V translation</h3>

<p>Vulkan consumes Shader code in SPIR-V intermediate language.
So, we need to translate our GLSL shader code into SPIR-V.
We will use glslangValidator tool for this purpose.
We need to modify CMakeLists.txt file slightly.
Modified parts are in bold:</p>

<pre>
# executable
<b>include(vkgMacros.cmake)
vkg_add_shaders("${APP_SHADERS}" APP_SHADER_DEPS)</b>
add_executable(${APP_NAME} ${APP_SOURCES} ${APP_INCLUDES} <b>${APP_SHADER_DEPS}</b>)

# target
set_property(TARGET ${APP_NAME} PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 20)
<b>target_include_directories(${APP_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})</b>
</pre>

<p>The macro vkg_add_shaders() will process all shaders and generate their SPIR-V counterparts.
APP_SHADER_DEPS variable will contain dependencies that we need to append to our executable.
Finally, we need to append include directory to CMake's binary dir
because that is where the SPIR-V shaders are generated and we need to include them from our source code.


<h3>Shader module</h3>

<p>A shader module is collection of shader code. It includes one or more functions with one or more entry points.
We will first include SPIR-V shader binary code in the beginning of our main.cpp file:</p>

<pre>
// shader code as SPIR-V binary
static const uint32_t performanceSpirv[] = {
#include "performance.comp.spv"
};
</pre>

<p>Then, we create the shader module inside our main() function:</p>

<pre>
// shader module
vk::UniqueShaderModule shaderModule =
	vk::createShaderModuleUnique(
		vk::ShaderModuleCreateInfo{
			.flags = {},
			.codeSize = sizeof(performanceSpirv),
			.pCode = performanceSpirv,
		}
	);
</pre>


<h3>Pipeline</h3>

<p>A pipeline controls how graphics or compute work is executed on the device.
Before we create pipeline, we need pipeline layout:</p>

<pre>
// pipeline layout
vk::UniquePipelineLayout pipelineLayout =
	vk::createPipelineLayoutUnique(
		vk::PipelineLayoutCreateInfo{
			.flags = {},
			.setLayoutCount = 0,
			.pSetLayouts = nullptr,
			.pushConstantRangeCount = 0,
			.pPushConstantRanges = nullptr,
		}
	);
</pre>

<p>Pipeline layout describes the set of resources and push constants used by a pipeline.
Set of resources is described by the collection of descriptor set layouts.
For now, we are not using any of these. So, we will skip them for now.</p>

<p>The compute pipeline is created as follows:</p>

<pre>
// pipeline
vk::UniquePipeline pipeline =
	vk::createComputePipelineUnique(
		nullptr,
		vk::ComputePipelineCreateInfo{
			.flags = {},
			.stage =
				vk::PipelineShaderStageCreateInfo{
					.flags = {},
					.stage = vk::ShaderStageFlagBits::eCompute,
					.module = shaderModule,
					.pName = "main",
					.pSpecializationInfo = nullptr,
				},
			.layout = pipelineLayout,
			.basePipelineHandle = nullptr,
			.basePipelineIndex = -1,
		}
	);
</pre>

<p>Particular shader used by the pipeline is specified in vk::PipelineShaderStageCreateInfo structure.
In stage member, we specify that it is compute shader.
In module member, we pass shaderModule created few moments before.
And in pName member, we specify the name of entry function that will be called when the execution of the shader starts.


<h3>Dispatch and workgroups</h3>

<p>Now, we need to record the work into our command buffer.
We will do it by the following code when recording command buffer:</p>

<pre>
// bind pipeline
vk::cmdBindPipeline(commandBuffer, vk::PipelineBindPoint::eCompute, pipeline);

// dispatch computation
constexpr const uint32_t groupCountX = 1000;
constexpr const uint32_t groupCountY = 100;
constexpr const uint32_t groupCountZ = 1;
vk::cmdDispatch(commandBuffer, groupCountX, groupCountY, groupCountZ);
</pre>

<p>First, we bind our pipeline. It is bound to the compute binding point.
So, all the following compute commands in this command buffer will use this pipeline
until another pipeline is bound to the compute binding point or until the command buffer recording ends.</p>

<p>The next call is vk::cmdDispatch(). It records the command to execute the work of the compute pipeline currently bound.
The work is not executed yet, it is just recorded.
In the command, the number of workgroups in X, Y and Z dimension are recorded.
We record 1000 workgroups in X dimension, 100 in Y dimension and 1 in Z dimension.
In total, it is 1000x100x1 = 100'000 workgroups.
These workgroups are called local workgroups, while all 100'000 local workgroups together will form one global workgroup
because it was provoked by single dispatch call. If we speak just about workgroups, we will mean local workgroups
that will be much more important for us.</p>

<p>A local workgroup is composed of compute shader invocations.
Their number is specified on the beginning of our compute shader as
<code>layout(local_size_x=32, local_size_y=4, local_size_z=1) in;</code>.
So, it is 32 x 4 x 1 of them. In total, 128 compute shader invocations.
If we multiply it by 100'000 local workgroups that we recorded into command buffer,
it is 12'800'000 compute shader invocations.</p>

<p>One more note: There are some limits on number of local workgroups
inside single global workgroup.
There are also limits on number of shader invocations inside local workgroup.
More details in collapsable section just for those interested.</p>

<details><summary>Limits on local workgroups and shader invocations</summary>

<p>Number of local workgroups inside single global workgroup has the following limitations:
<ul><li>Number of workgroups in X dimension must be less than or equal to VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxComputeWorkGroupCount[0].</li>
<li>Number of workgroups in Y dimension must be less than or equal to VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxComputeWorkGroupCount[1].</li>
<li>Number of workgroups in Z dimension must be less than or equal to VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxComputeWorkGroupCount[2].</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Minimal value of VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxComputeWorkGroupCount is (65535, 65535, 65535) as required by Vulkan specification.</p>

<p>Number of compute shader invocations inside a local workgroup has the following limitations:
<ul><li>Number of invocations in X dimension must be less than or equal to VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxComputeWorkGroupSize[0].</li>
<li>Number of invocations in Y dimension must be less than or equal to VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxComputeWorkGroupSize[1].</li>
<li>Number of invocations in Z dimension must be less than or equal to VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxComputeWorkGroupSize[2].</li>
<li>Total number of invocations must be less than or equal to VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxComputeWorkGroupInvocations.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Minimal value of VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxComputeWorkGroupSize is (128, 128, 64) as required by Vulkan specification.</p>

<p>Minimal value of VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxComputeWorkGroupInvocations is 128 as required by Vulkan specification.</p>

</details>


<h3>Submission and print results</h3>

<p>Now, we will submit the work.
To measure the execution time, we first get the current time (code in bold):</p>

<pre>
// submit work
cout &lt;&lt; "Submiting work and waiting for it..." &lt;&lt; endl;
<b>chrono::time_point t1 = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();</b>
vk::queueSubmit(
	queue,
	vk::SubmitInfo{
		.waitSemaphoreCount = 0,
		.pWaitSemaphores = nullptr,
		.pWaitDstStageMask = nullptr,
		.commandBufferCount = 1,
		.pCommandBuffers = &commandBuffer,
		.signalSemaphoreCount = 0,
		.pSignalSemaphores = nullptr,
	},
	computingFinishedFence
);
</pre>

<p>Then, we wait for the fence. When the submitted work execution is completed,
the fence is signalled, and we take the current time again (in bold):</p>

<pre>
// wait for the work
vk::Result r =
	vk::waitForFence_noThrow(
		computingFinishedFence,
		uint64_t(3e9)  // timeout (3s)
	);
<b>chrono::time_point t2 = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();</b>
if(r == vk::Result::eTimeout)
	throw std::runtime_error("GPU timeout. Task is probably hanging.");
else
	vk::checkForSuccessValue(r, "vkWaitForFences");
</pre>

<p>Now, we can print the computation time and performance:</p>

<pre>
// print results
double delta = chrono::duration<double>(t2 - t1).count();
cout &lt;&lt; "Computation time: " &lt;&lt; delta * 1e3 &lt;&lt; "ms." &lt;&lt; endl;
constexpr uint64_t numInstructions = uint64_t(20000) * 128 * groupCountX * groupCountY * groupCountZ;
cout &lt;&lt; "Computing performance: " &lt;&lt; double(numInstructions) / delta * 1e-12 &lt;&lt; " TFLOPS." &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre>

<p>For computing the performance in TFLOPS, we need number of executed instructions.
We executed groupCountX * groupCountY * groupCountZ local workgroups.
It is 1'000 in X dimension, 100 in Y dimension and 1 in Z dimension. In total, 100'000 workgroups.
Each workgroup is composed of compute shader invocations.
Their number is specified on the beginning of the compute shader as
<code>layout(local_size_x=32, local_size_y=4, local_size_z=1) in;</code>.
So, it is 32x4x1 of them. 128 in total.
When combined with number of local workgroups, we have 128 x 100'000 = 12'800'000 shader invocations.
Finally, each compute shader invocation executes 10'000 multiplications and 10'000 additions.
It is 20'000 floating operations.
So, the whole computation is composed of 20'000 x 12'800'000 = 256'000'000'000 floating point operations.
We can write 256 giga operations, or 0.256 tera operations.
Now, if we divide it by execution time, we get the performance in GFLOPS/TFLOPS
(Giga/Tera FLoating-point Operations Per Second).
If, for example, the execution took 10 milliseconds, we divide it by 0.01 (in seconds) and receive 25.6 TFLOPS.
Such number would mean quite good graphics card for the time of writing of this article in 2025.</p>
