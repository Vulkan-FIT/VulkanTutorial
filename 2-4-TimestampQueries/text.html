<h3>2-4 - Timestamp Queries</h3>

<p>Using chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() is the CPU way to get the current time.
However, Vulkan provides its own way to get the current time directly on the device.
Getting the time directly on the device avoids unnecessary overhead and
might provide higher precision of the measurement.</p>

<p>Vulkan provides vkCmdWriteTimestamp function to request timestamp and to write it to the memory:</p>

<pre>
void vkCmdWriteTimestamp(
	VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer,
	VkPipelineStageFlagBits pipelineStage,
	VkQueryPool queryPool,
	uint32_t query);
</pre>

<p>The command is recorded into the command buffer specified by the first parameter.
The second parameter gives the pipeline stage that must be completed before the write timestamp command is executed.
Vulkan devices might execute commands in parallel and sometimes out of submission order.
Moreover, commands are executed in stages, such as compute shader stage, vertex shader stage,
geometry shader stage and fragment shader stage.
All commands submitted before vkCmdWriteTimestamp must complete execution of at least the stage
specified by pipelineStage parameter before the timestamp command can be executed.
Third parameter queryPool specifies the object where the timestamp will be stored.
Finally, fourth parameter specifies index of the query inside queryPool where the result will be stored.</p>

<p>The command buffer is recorded as follows:</p>

<pre>
// reset timestamp pool
vk::cmdResetQueryPool(
	commandBuffer,
	timestampPool,
	0,  // firstQuery
	2);  // queryCount

// bind pipeline
vk::cmdBindPipeline(commandBuffer, vk::PipelineBindPoint::eCompute, pipeline);

// write timestamp 0
vk::cmdWriteTimestamp(
	commandBuffer,
	vk::PipelineStageFlagBits::eTopOfPipe,
	timestampPool,
	0);  // query

// dispatch computation
vk::cmdDispatch(commandBuffer, groupCountX, groupCountY, groupCountZ);

// write timestamp 1
vk::cmdWriteTimestamp(
	commandBuffer,
	vk::PipelineStageFlagBits::eBottomOfPipe,
	timestampPool,
	1);  // query
</pre>

<p>First, we reset query pool and bind the pipeline. Then, we write first timestamp,
record the work using vk::cmdDispatch() and write the second timestamp.</p>

<p>When the command buffer is executed, the timestamps are written by the device into the query pool.
After waiting for the command buffer execution to complete, we read the timestamps:</p>

<pre>
// read timestamps
array<uint64_t, 2> timestamps;
vk::getQueryPoolResults(
	timestampPool,  // queryPool
	0,  // firstQuery
	2,  // queryCount
	2 * sizeof(uint64_t),  // dataSize
	timestamps.data(),  // pData
	sizeof(uint64_t),  // stride
	vk::QueryResultFlagBits::e64 | vk::QueryResultFlagBits::eWait  // flags
);

// print results
double time = float((timestamps[1] - timestamps[0]) & timestampValidBitMask) * timestampPeriod / 1e9;
double totalTime = chrono::duration<double>(chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() - startTime).count();
uint64_t numInstructions = uint64_t(20000) * 128 * groupCountX * groupCountY * groupCountZ;
cout << fixed << setprecision(2)
     << setw(9) << totalTime * 1000 << "ms       "
     << setw(9) << groupCountX * groupCountY * groupCountZ << "        "
     << "     " << formatFloatSI(time) << "s   "
     << "    " << formatFloatSI(double(numInstructions) / time) << "FLOPS" << endl;
</pre>

<p>We read two timestamps as two 64-bit integers. We substract them to get their difference,
perform logical and with timestampValidBitMask to limit the result just to valid bits,
and finally, we multiply it by timestampPeriod and divide by 1e9 to get the time difference in seconds.
The variable timestampPeriod contains number of nanoseconds that pass
to make timestamp incremented by one. At the end, the results and printed to the screen.</p>

<p>The last missing piece of the code is query pool creation:</p>

<pre>
// timestamp pool
vk::UniqueQueryPool timestampPool =
	vk::createQueryPoolUnique(
		vk::QueryPoolCreateInfo{
			.flags = {},
			.queryType = vk::QueryType::eTimestamp,
			.queryCount = 2,
			.pipelineStatistics = {},
		}
	);
</pre>

<p>We choose to store timestamps in the pool and to store two values there.</p>

<p>We can run the example and see if we got any additional precision in this simple application.
On my Quadro RTX 3000, I see the real difference in first few measurements.
Dispatching 1, 10 or 100 workgroups results in as short measurement time as 100 us when using timestamps.
Without timestamps, the overhead is much longer in these three measurements.
I see values ranging from 250 to 600 us that have its roots in CPU - GPU synchronization.
When measurement time is about 20ms, the difference is still there but it is probably not noticeable to the user.</p>
