<h1>Vulkan Tutorial</h1>

<h3>Device Info</h3>

<p>Vulkan is multi-device, multi-vendor and multi-threaded API. These facts are reflected in its architecture.
Simplified Vulkan architecture is shown on the following picture:</p>

<p>On the left side, there is a set of applications using Vulkan API.
On the right side, there is a set of Vulkan drivers.
Often, there is only one driver of the only graphics card in the system.
But there might be two if we have discrete and integrated graphics card.
There might be also CPU Vulkan driver that implements Vulkan functionality in software.
In between the set of applications and set of drivers,
there is Vulkan Loader that processes application requests and
makes appropriate calls into the particular Vulkan driver.</p>
